# Context 

This technical report covers the establishment of field sample locations for the Improved "National Forest Inventory Plan for Indonesia Forest". The main document proposes a two-phases systematic stratified design with target sampling sizes for seven strata of dryland forest and one strata of mangrove forest.

Three annexes to the main report describe:
1. Optimal sampling grids for the NFI phase 1 visual interpretation.
1. Results of the NFI Phase 1 visual interpretation.
1. Distribution of the NFI Phase 2 field sample location (this report).

A separate annex is dedicated to Mangrove, Mangrove sampling is not addressed in this report.


# Method

Given a final dataset of NFI phase 1 visually interpreted samples, the general approach to selecting the NFI phase 2 samples was as follows:

1. Determine the distance of each sample along a space filling curve (SFC), following Hilbert's distance and computed with Python dask-geopandas [library](https://dask-geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/reference/api/dask_geopandas.GeoSeries.hilbert_distance.html)).
1. Select samples along the curve based on a sampling proportion, itself calculated with the number of plots in the pool (i.e. the NFI phase 1 plots), the number of target plots to sample (i.e. the number of target plot for the Phase 2) and adjustment factors to take into consideration: the proportion of accessible forest plots in the pool and the uncertainty around the identification of forest / non-forest in the Phase 1. 
1. A random starting point is assigned then the selection is systematic following the space filling curve. 
1. The adjustment factors are tailored manually to provide a number of forest plots slightly exceeding the target.
1. All natural forest samples are kept, 70 samples are randomly selected among the accessible Trees Outside Forest samples.
1. Separately, additional samples in primary forest are provided for an intensification study for forest types that cover an area too small to be effectively represented in a national level sampling design.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
